turbomem

This is the development of a reverse-engineered Linux driver for the Intel(R)
Turbo Memory PCIe NAND flash chip. The goal is to expose the flash memory as
a block device. Any caching operations will have to be layered on top by other
kernel features.

The driver does not yet do much except resetting the chip. Reading from the
flash is under development next.
