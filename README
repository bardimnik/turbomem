turbomem - Linux driver for Intel(R) Turbo Memory Controller


This is the development of a reverse-engineered Linux driver for the Intel(R)
Turbo Memory Controller, a mini-PCIe board that contains NAND flash and a
controller chip. This driver will expose the flash memory to the Linux MTD
(Memory Technology Device) layer, which in turn can setup filesystems on top.

After detecting a compatible device, basic info is logged to dmesg:
turbomem 0000:04:00.0: Found Intel Turbo Memory Controller (rev 11)
turbomem 0000:04:00.0: Device characteristics: 13404, flash size: 2048 MB


Notes:
------
* The supplied Vista driver requires certain SATA controller chips to install
  and work. Since this driver does no disk filtering hopefully the Turbo Memory
  will work in any board with a mini-PCIe connector.

* If you use both Linux and Windows on the computer with this card, uninstall
  the Turbo Memory driver in Windows before using this driver. Data on the card
  will be corrupted otherwise since both drivers do not use it in the same way.

* This driver is developed using the 2GB version of the board. If the 1 and 4GB
  versions use the same flash layout they should also work, otherwise some
  adjustment will be needed. Get in touch if you run into problems.

* /turbomem/turbomemX/wipe_flash (write)
  Write anything here to erase the flash memory. Watch out.
  Example:

# echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/turbomem/turbomema/wipe_flash
turbomem 0000:04:00.0: Wiping flash!
turbomem 0000:04:00.0: Erase complete: 102 blocks failed.
